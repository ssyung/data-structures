Part 1. Data Model

I placed my photon device with temperature and light sensor in our refrigerator to track the frequency/duration of door openings (light on) and loss/recovery of temperature. I plan to record data every second, in order to capture all door opening occurrences (knowing I will have a lot of data just showing the fridge door closed, steady temperature). Iâ€™m interested in tracking frequency of door openings (during the day, during dinner prep, late night snacks!) as well as seeing loss/recovery of temperature based off of duration of door being left open.

Part 2. SQL code

CREATE TABLE fridge_readings (
photo integer,
temperature decimal, 
fridgeTime timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp);

INSERT INTO fridge_readings VALUES (29, 8.989011, DEFAULT);
